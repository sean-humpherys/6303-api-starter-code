Task: Get and display a list of countries from an API server at
https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/2/all_countries.php 

API Documentation at https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php 

The hardest part with API data is figuring out how to access the data
becuase the data is usually nested inside lists and dictionaries inside
of other lists or other dicionaries. 
Every API server is different in how it embeds data inside 
lists and dictionaries. You just need to peel back every layer of a list 
or a dictionary until you get the data you want.
